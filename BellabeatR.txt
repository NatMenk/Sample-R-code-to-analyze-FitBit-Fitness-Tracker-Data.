## In this project we analyze smart device (fitness tracker) data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.
## Sample R code exploring FitBit Fitness Tracker Data: from Kaggle.com.

## Installing Packages and setting the environment:
install.packages('tidyverse')
library("tidyverse")

## Loading csv files from the data set and exploring a few key tables 
sleep_day <- read.csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
View(sleep_day)
head(sleep_day)
daily_activity <- read.csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
View(daily_activity)
head(daily_activity)
colnames(daily_activity)
colnames(sleep_day)
## Both tables have Id column

##Exploring some summary statistics:
##How many unique participants are there in each data frame? It looks like there may be more participants in the daily activity dataset than the sleep dataset.
n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
n_distinct(sleep_day$Id)

##How many observations are there in each data frame?
nrow(daily_activity)
nrow(sleep_day)
##What are some quick summary statistics we'd want to know about each data frame?
##For the daily activity dataframe:
daily_activity %>%  
  select(TotalSteps,
         TotalDistance,
         SedentaryMinutes) %>%
  summary()
## And for Sleep dataframe:
sleep_day %>%  
  select(TotalSleepRecords,
         TotalMinutesAsleep,
         TotalTimeInBed) %>%
  summary()
##Plotting a few explorations
##What's the relationship between steps taken in a day and sedentary minutes? How could this help inform the customer segments that we can market to? E.g. position this more as a way to get started in walking more? Or to measure steps that you're already taking?
ggplot(data=daily_activity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=SedentaryMinutes)) + geom_point()
##What's the relationship between minutes asleep and time in bed? You might expect it to be almost completely linear - are there any unexpected trends?
ggplot(data=sleep_day, aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=TotalTimeInBed)) + geom_point()
## Merging these two datasets together: 
combined_data <- merge(sleep_day, daily_activity, by="Id")
n_distinct(combined_data$Id)
##Note that there were more participant Ids in the daily activity dataset that have been filtered out using merge.
